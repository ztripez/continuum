# Cargo configuration for Continuum
#
# Chumsky parser combinator library creates deeply nested recursive types
# that require more stack space for construction. This sets a larger default
# stack size to prevent overflow during parser initialization.

[env]
RUST_MIN_STACK = "16777216"  # 16 MB stack (default is typically 2-8 MB)
