# Chronicles

This document defines **Chronicles** in Continuum.

Chronicles are **observer-side interpretations** of causal history.

They assign meaning to what happened, without influencing what happens.

## 1. What a Chronicle Is

A **Chronicle** is an interpreted record derived from simulation output.

A chronicle:
- observes fields and signals
- detects patterns or conditions
- records annotations, labels, or events
- does not influence execution

Chronicles exist entirely outside causality.

## 2. Chronicles vs Fractures

Chronicles and fractures must not be confused.

| Aspect | Fracture | Chronicle |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Phase | Fracture | Observer |
| Role | Causal | Interpretive |
| Writes | Signal inputs | Records only |
| Can affect execution | Yes | No |

Chronicles describe.
Fractures act.

## 3. Chronicle Triggers

Chronicles may define triggers.

Triggers:
- read fields or resolved signals
- detect conditions of interest
- record entries when conditions hold

Triggers must not:
- write signals
- emit impulses
- alter execution

---

## 4. Chronicle Output

Chronicles may produce:
- annotations
- tagged intervals
- named phenomena
- summaries or statistics

Chronicle output is:
- non-authoritative
- observer-specific
- optional

Removing chronicles must not change simulation results.

---

## 5. Chronicles and Time

Chronicles are indexed by:
- tick
- era
- optional duration

Chronicles do not define time.
They interpret it.

---

## 6. Chronicles and Determinism

Chronicles should be deterministic with respect to their inputs.

Given the same causal history:
- the same chronicles should be produced

Chronicle determinism matters for analysis,
but never for causality.

---

## 7. What Chronicles Are Not

Chronicles are **not**:
- events in the simulation
- triggers for logic
- part of the execution graph
- authoritative records

They are **interpretive overlays**.

---

## Summary

- Chronicles interpret causal history
- They never influence execution
- They are observer-only
- Meaning lives here, not in the World

If removing chronicles changes results,
the observer boundary has been violated.
