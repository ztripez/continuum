# MANIFESTO

> **Systems evolve. Structure is a consequence.**  
> **Structure emerges from tension.**

Continuum models **causality**, not outcomes.

Nothing is authored.
Nothing is resolved externally.
Nothing is random without cause.

Only **forces, constraints, incentives, and coupling** may be introduced.
If it cannot emerge, it does not belong.

> **Causality defines the system.**  
> **Context gives it form.**  
> **Observation gives it meaning.**
